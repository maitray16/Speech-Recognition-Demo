# Speech-Recognition-Demo

In this demo I built a LSTM recurrent neural network using the TFLearn high level Tensorflow-based library to train on a labeled dataset of spoken digits. Then test it on spoken digits. 

Usage
===========

Run the following code in terminal. This will take a couple hours to train fully.

`python demo.py`
